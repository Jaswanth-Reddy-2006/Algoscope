# Algoscope: Deep Cognitive Algorithm Learning

Algoscope is not just an algorithm visualizer—it is a **cognitive architecture regarding algorithmic mastery**. It bridges the gap between rote memorization and deep, multi-dimensional understanding.

Traditional platforms teach you *what* an algorithm does. Algoscope teaches you *how to think* about it, *why* it works, and *where* it breaks.

## Core Philosophy: The Tri-Layer Curriculum

We dissect every algorithm through three distinct lenses, ensuring holistic mastery:

1.  **Academic Layer**: Focuses on formal invariants, mathematical proofs, stability analysis, and recurrence relations. This builds the theoretical bedrock.
2.  **Competitive Layer**: Analyzes constraints (N ≤ 10⁵), optimization tricks, and template patterns. This prepares you for high-pressure implementation.
3.  **Interview Layer**: Simulates real-world interrogation. We explore edge cases, common traps, and "what if" scenarios (e.g., "Implement this without recursion").

## Real-Time Visualization Engine

Our engine goes beyond static animations. It provides a real-time, interactive window into the algorithm's state:

*   **Recursion Trees**: Watch the stack unfold and collapse in real-time, visualizing the branching factor and depth.
*   **Graph Traversal**: See nodes change state from *unvisited* to *visiting* to *visited*, illuminating the frontier of exploration.
*   **Performance Simulation**: Adjust input sizes dynamically (from 10 to 1 million elements) and watch the predicted runtime growth, visualizing the difference between O(N) and O(N²).

## 3D Mastery Tracking

Progress bars are insufficient. Algoscope tracks your "Cognitive Map" across three dimensions:

*   **Theory Score**: Do you understand the proof?
*   **Optimization Score**: Can you make it run within 1 second?
*   **Edge-Case Score**: Does your code crash on an empty array?

## The Evolution Timeline

Algorithms don't exist in a vacuum. We visualize the **pedagogical lineage**:
*   *Selection Sort* → *Insertion Sort* → *Merge Sort* → *Quick Sort* → *Heap Sort*

By understanding this evolution, you see how each algorithm solves the bottlenecks of its predecessor.

## Cognitive Transfer

The ultimate goal is **Transfer Learning**. Algoscope explicitly maps foundational patterns (e.g., "Sliding Window") to complex, unseen problems, helping you recognize underlying structures in novel challenges.
